# spidr

With spidr, we explore what is possible when we bring some of the latest developments in programming language theory and machine learning hardware to probabilistic modelling. We hope to help developers find new ways to write and verify robust, performant and practical machine learning utilities, libraries and frameworks; allow machine learning researchers to find new research avenues with tools that are easy to compose, modify and extend; and allow those new to machine learning learn about common or useful algorithms. To these ends, we aim to make spidr

  - **robust** by leveraging the dependent types and theorem proving offered by [Idris 2](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2), and thorough testing
  - **performant** by using [Graphcore's PopLibs library](https://github.com/graphcore/poplibs) for machine learning on the IPU
  - **composable** via a purely functional API
  - **practical** with lightweight and intuitive APIs
  - **informative** with clear and extensive documentation

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Contributions are welcome.
