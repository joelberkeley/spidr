||| This module contains definitions of function optimizers.
module Optimize

import Tensor

||| An `Optimizer` finds the value, in a `Tensor`-valued feature space, which (approximately)
||| optimizes a scalar-valued function over that space.
|||
||| @domain The type of the domain over which to find the optimal value.
public export 0
Optimizer : (0 domain : Type) -> Type
Optimizer a = (a -> Ref $ Tensor [] F64) -> Ref a

||| Construct an `Optimizer` that implements grid search over a scalar feature space. Grid search
||| approximates the optimum by evaluating the objective over a finite, evenly-spaced grid.
|||
||| **NOTE** This function is not yet implemented.
|||
||| @density The density of the grid.
||| @lower The lower (inclusive) bound of the grid.
||| @upper The upper (exclusive) bound of the grid.
export
gridSearch : (density : Tensor [d] U32) ->
             (lower : Tensor [d] F64) ->
             (upper : Tensor [d] F64) ->
             Optimizer $ Tensor [d] F64
