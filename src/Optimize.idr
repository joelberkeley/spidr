||| This module contains definitions of function optimizers.
module Optimize

import Tensor

||| An `Optimizer` finds the value, in a `Tensor`-valued feature space, which (approximately)
||| optimizes a scalar-valued function over that space.
|||
||| If the function is not well-defined at points in the feature space, and this is expressed by
||| wrapping function values in some context, this extra context can be captured in the value `m`.
||| For example, a function `a -> Maybe (Tensor [] Double)`, can be optimized by an
||| `Optimizer {m=Maybe} a`.
|||
||| @domain The type of the domain over which to find the optimizer.
public export 0
Optimizer : {default id 0 m : Type -> Type} -> (0 domain : Type) -> Type
Optimizer a = (a -> m $ Ref $ Tensor [] F64) -> m a

||| Construct an `Optimizer` that implements grid search over a scalar feature space. Grid search
||| approximates the optimum by evaluating the objective over a finite, evenly-spaced grid.
|||
||| **NOTE** This function is not yet implemented.
|||
||| @density The density of the grid.
||| @lower The lower (inclusive) bound of the grid.
||| @upper The upper (exclusive) bound of the grid.
