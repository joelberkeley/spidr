||| A dependent variant of `flip` where the return type can depend on the input values. `dflip`
||| flips the order of arguments for a function, such that `dflip f x y` is the same as `f y x`.

Neq : Nat -> Nat -> Type
Neq x y = Either (LT x y) (GT x y)

namespace Vect
  ||| All numbers from `0` to `n - 1` inclusive, in increasing order.

  ||| Enumerate entries in a vector with their indices. For example, `enumerate [5, 7, 9]`
  ||| is `[(0, 5), (1, 7), (2, 9)]`.

  ||| `True` if there are no duplicate elements in the list, else `False`.
