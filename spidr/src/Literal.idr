||| Defines `Literal`, a single value or array of values with a specified shape. It is similar to
||| the `Tensor` type, but differs in a number of important ways:
|||
||| * `Literal` offers a convenient syntax for constructing `Literal`s with boolean and numeric
|||   contents. For example, `True`, `1` and `[1, 2, 3]` are all valid `Literal`s. This makes it
|||   useful for constructing `Tensor`s.
||| * `Literal` is *not* accelerated by XLA, so operations on large `Literal`s, and large sequences
|||   of operations on any `Literal`, can be expected to be slower than they would on an equivalent
|||   `Tensor`.
||| * A `Literal` is implemented in pure Idris. As such, it can contain elements of any type, and
|||   implements a number of standard Idris interfaces. This, along with its convenient syntax,
|||   makes it particularly useful for testing operations on `Tensor`s.
