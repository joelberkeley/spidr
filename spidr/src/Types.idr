module Types

||| Describes the shape of a `Tensor`. For example, a `Tensor` of `Double`s with contents
||| `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]` has two elements in its outer-most axis, and each of those elements
||| has three `Double`s in it, so this has shape [2, 3]. A `Tensor` can have axes of zero length,
||| though the shape cannot be unambiguously inferred by visualising it. For example, `[[], []]`
||| can have shape [2, 0], [2, 0, 5] or etc. A scalar `Tensor` has shape `[]`.

||| An `Array shape dtype` is either:
||| 
||| * a single value of type `dtype` (for `shape` `[]`), or
||| * an arbitrarily nested array of `Vect`s of such values (for any other `shape`)
|||
||| @shape The shape of the array.
||| @dtype The type of elements of the array.

||| A type `a` satisfying `Bounded a` has a minimum and a maximum value.
